# Visual Studio extension to support Camel-K

This extension is a work-in-progress to explore what options we can add to VS Code to support Camel-K.

Note that it currently requires that both Camel-K and Minikube be installed and available on the system path.

To install Minikube and Camel-K, see [Installing MiniKube and Camel-K](configure-minikube-camelk.md).

## Kubernetes tools in VS Code

The [Kubernetes Tools extension from Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools) offers a number of tools we can use with Minikube and Camel-K. With a local Minikube instance running, you can see your local clusters appear in the Kubernetes Activity view.

With any node appearing in a Minikube cluster, you can easily follow the logs by right-clicking and selecting "Follow Logs" in the context menu.

This opens a log for that pod in a new Terminal window.

## Starting new Camel-K integrations

Once your Camel-K/Minikube environment is running and the vscode-camelk extension is installed, you can easily start a new Camel-K integration from a Java (*.java), Camel XML (Spring DSL) (*.xml), or Groovy (*.groovy) file. (JavaScript and Kotlin files may be supported in the future.) To do this, right-click on the Java, XML, or Groovy file, and select "Start Camel-K (Filetype) Integration."

| File Type | Menu Title |
| --------- | ---------- |
| XML (*.xml) | Start Camel-K XML Integration |
| Groovy (*.groovy) | Start Camel-K Groovy Integration |
| Java (*.java) | Start Camel-K Java Integration |

With [Language Support for Apache Camel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=camel-tooling.vscode-apache-camel) installed, you also get LSP support for Camel XML and Java routes:

LSP support is also coming for other file types (such as Groovy). And we will investigate adding run support for *.class files.

## 'Start Camel-K Integration' menu results

If Camel-K (Kamel) is in the system path, we can simply call the 'kamel' utility with appropriate options to run a particular file when the user wishes. For example, if I have a simple workspace with a Groovy file...

![Run Menu](images/kubernetes-view-camelk-run-xml-menu.jpg)

That launches my 'kamel' process from an XML file in the directory of the file (i.e. `kamel run --dev "filename"`) and I can see the output:

![Run Output](images/kubernetes-view-camelk-run-output.jpg)

## Stopping running Camel-K integrations

In addition, there is a menu to stop a running integration. To do this, right-click on the Java, XML, or Groovy file, and select "Stop Camel-K (Filetype) Integration."

| File Type | Menu Title |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Java (*.java) | Stop Camel-K Java Integration |
| XML (*.xml) | Stop Camel-K XML Integration |
| Groovy (*.groovy) | Stop Camel-K Groovy Integration |

![Stop menu](images/kubernetes-view-camelk-run-xml-menu.jpg)

"Stop Camel-K Integration" essentially calls `kamel delete '${filename}'` to stop the running integration in the system.

## Camel-K Integrations view

The Camel-K Integrations view offers a list of the "integrations" registered with the current Camel-K context. If you right-click on a running integration, you can "Remove" an integration to stop them in the system.

![Camel-K integrations view Remove](images/camelk-integrations-view-remove-menu.jpg)

The view has a "Refresh" button that can be used to manually trigger a refresh of the list, but when you add/remove file-based integrations in the Explorer view, it should refresh automatically.

## Known Issues

Here's the current list of issues we're working to resolve. If you find a new issue, please [create a new issue report in GitHub](https://github.com/camel-tooling/vscode-camelk/issues)!

* Do not pollute all Groovy files with Camel-K [Issue #7](https://github.com/camel-tooling/vscode-camelk/issues/7) - this is also a problem for XML and Java files at this time
* Use Kubernetes rest api instead of kubectl calls [Issue #14](https://github.com/camel-tooling/vscode-camelk/issues/14)

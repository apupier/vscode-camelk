Press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` to bring up the Command Palette, and type `Create a new Apache Camel K Integration file`. When the command is selected, click Enter.

1. Choose the language to use (For instance, choose `Java`).
2. Choose the workspace folder (press Enter to select the current workspace root folder)
3. Provide a name for the new file (be sure not to include the file extension or it will be repeated) (For instance, type `Simple`)

When you complete step 3, you should see the file `Simple.java` appear in your workspace folder.

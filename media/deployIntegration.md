It is assumed that you have a running Camel K instance to which you are connected to.

The `Tooling for Camel K` extension offers several tools to get your new integration started. 

First, you can right-click the `Simple.java` file and select `Start Apache Camel K Integration`. That will provide a drop-down in the Command palette area with a number of deployment options. The most common case is the dev mode to have modification automatically detected. Select the `Dev Mode - Apache Camel K Integration in Dev Mode` option.

Since this is likely the first time you've started a new integration in Camel K, it might take a bit to spin up the necessary resources on the target system.
